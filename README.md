# linkedin-job-scraper
Automated scraping tool for extracting job market data from linkedin


# Tools Used 

- Python 
  - Beautiful Soup
  



#Points to note


# Challenges faced
LinkedIn is not a static website and dynamically adds more job listings as you scroll down, this means you will only be able to see 25 listings when you request.
Continuing to build the pipeline though as it is more for learning than using effectively
